In order to run p2pool with the Litecoin network, you would need to build and install the
ltc_scrypt module that includes the scrypt proof of work code that Litecoin uses for hashes.

Linux:
    cd p2pool/litecoin
    sudo python setup.py install

Windows:
    cd p2pool\litecoin
    C:\Python27\python.exe setup.py build --compile=mingw32 install

If you run into an error with unrecognized command line option '-mno-cygwin', see this:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6034390/compiling-with-cython-and-mingw-produces-gcc-error-unrecognized-command-line-o

You also need to install Twisted:

And Zope.Interface:
    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface/3.8.0 (for Windows, unzip it into C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages)

To use p2pool, you must be running your own local litecoind. p2pool connects to
this litecoin over both its p2p interface and its RPC interface. For standard
configurations, using p2p should be as simple as:

    python run_p2pool.py --net litecoin <rpc_username> <rpc_password>

Then run your miner program, connecting to 127.0.0.1 on port 9327 (19327 for testnet) with any
username and password.


If you are behind a NAT, it will help to enable TCP port forwarding on your
router. Forward port 9338 (19338 for testnet) to the host running p2pool.py.


Use

    python run_p2pool.py --help

for additional options.
